# ReflowOven
A reflow oven controller designed in KiCAD, by Jaden Bottemiller

This project is designed to use an STM32 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. 

All onboard devices interface to the microcontroller using I2C (with the exception of the SD Card Slot, which uses SPI). Also has a CAN interface, USB 2.0, and SWD. Features four seven segment displays, three buttons, and a rotary encoder with a custom logic circuit that interfaces with an I2C binary up/down counter to increment, decrement, and maintain accuracy of the relative position of the encoder.

Here is a rendering of the board with all of the parts modelled.
Some models from online resources or default in KiCAD, but many were made by me in Solidworks.

The user interface portion of the board is able to be cut off so that it can be placed anywhere in a mechanical chassis for ease of construction.

Here is the board as seen by default in the KiCAD PCBnew Software.
